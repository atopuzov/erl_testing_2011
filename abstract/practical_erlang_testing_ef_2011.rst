Bob Ippolito is CTO and cofounder of Mochi Media (now a subsidiary of
Shanda Games). Bob started using Erlang in 2006 to prototype an ad
server, and it quickly became the de facto platform for building
servers at Mochi. Bob's open source contributions to the Erlang
community include mochiweb, statebox, egeoip and kvc.

Abstract
--------

At Mochi we've spent a lot of time learning about how stressful and
time consuming it is to let bad code slip into production. We've also
learned a lot about how to avoid these mistakes by using tools to help
us improve code quality and prevent regressions. My goal with this
talk is to document and demonstrate the techniques we've developed to
make our Erlang code better, hopefully saving you from making some of
the mistakes we've made in the past.
